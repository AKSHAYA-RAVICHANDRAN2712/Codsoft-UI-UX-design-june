Heyy guys........Hello All. Happy to share my first task in CodSoft under the domain UI/UX Design. 
Task : 1 *Mobile App Signup Flow*
 
UI (User Interface) is all about the look and feel of a product or service. It's the visual language that users interact with, and it should be both aesthetically pleasing and easy to use.

 UX (User Experience) is the broader concept of how a user feels when interacting with a product or service.

How would you describe a UI UX designer?

UX / UI designers participate in both the design thinking process and execute a visual product. Therefore, they need a range of technical skills like UX research, wireframing and prototyping, interaction design, visual communication, and information architecture.

To summarize: 
UX design is all about identifying and solving user problems; UI design is all about creating intuitive, aesthetically-pleasing, interactive interfaces. UX design usually comes first in the product development process, followed by UI.
Simply put, an onboarding flow is a step-by-step process that introduces users to a new app. It walks them through the main features, benefits, and how to effectively use the app.

The signup flow is one of the most critical aspects of the user experience journey. It is the initial encounter that a user has with your product. The way you design it can have a major impact on how users perceive your product.

Here, I had created a figma model for the mobile signup flow for To-do-list app.Thanks for ur time ,Kepp supporting.
